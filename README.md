We are building a data augmentation tool that understand geo-locations/addresses in natural language and produces a result that gives more information such as locality, geo-location,classification 
of building(lot, apartment, hospital, house, etc.) at that address,satellite image of the terrain and a classification of what that image represents: if the address is located in a city,
rural, suburban, industrial etc. This tool can be given a database of addresses/location and can iteratively augment that database with more relevant information that the handler might need.
This tool could be used globally.
