problem statement

context
primary delivery of benefits, ei, cpp, etc
half of its benefit processing
half is program integrity validation
right ppl right benefit right time
fraud, identity theft detection
"is the right person being paid the right amount"

data driven integrity
identity
	are you x
location
	do you live at x
employer
	do you work at x
employment
	did you work x hrs for $x

looking through dataset for anomalies to hand off to investigators
use predictive models for income discrepancy, sickness
risk mapping, risk models to get tips
look at 4 main areas above
one of the problems to be addressed in this hackathon is address/region
some regions have different typical ei drains, regional discrepancy

what contextual information can we add to an address? 
how important is location?
what do we know about a location that /could/ be useful?

address validation - not a PO box, is address being rented by someone else and they are not in country
is it a commercial or residential area? 
vacant lot? 
some of these things happen in some parts of the country, but not in the other
perhaps situate thinking in only certain parts of the country, doesnt need to be that overarching

often there is misleading or wrong information online

objectives
	append meaningful information to an address that could be used for analytics
	generate address profiles for integrity and service improvements
	generate insights of value for integrity and service improvements
	generate visualisation tools to explore address characteristics/insights

some example datasets and conclusions
	dont think about building an app
	look at small num datasets
	"seeing the forest from the trees"
	maybe try to get one functional model as demo
	but soln arch is more important than actual soln

	ex1
		breaks down into 2 parts

		enrchment
			use, clean, enhnce
		integrity
			indentify, clarify, qualify

		problem statement
			given address, get probability of it being a
			>commerical/business address
			>residential address

		grab some datasets and merge on postal code,
		may need to clean postal codes

	ex2
		prob stmt
			which sector for some addr
			uses coop ds to find addrs of corp areas
			does same for school, restos etc
			add class for each, bind to residential ds by postal code
			can easily create a nn, maybe even a cnn to build a sl-classifier
			obviously clean out nul vals first

	image classification

	these 3 examples will be om server but not the scan slide


communication of result or expected result is more important than actual result as far as judging process goes
